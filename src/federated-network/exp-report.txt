with learning rate of 1 (or 0.1), the network does not learn anything
we should use typical learning rates for this network, around 1e-3
the averaging step and passing the averaged network to the server network works
more advanced testing with these options :
--normalization batch --epochs 1 --rounds 100 --batchsize 10 --client_proportion 0.1 (lr=1e-3, wd = 5e-4)
test set accuracy :
20 rounds : 0.25
40 rounds : 0.37
60 rounds : 0.42
80 rounds : 0.45
100 rounds : 0.48
