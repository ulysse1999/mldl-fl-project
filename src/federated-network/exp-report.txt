with learning rate of 1 (or 0.1), the network does not learn anything
we should use typical learning rates for this network, around 1e-3
the averaging step and passing the averaged network to the server network works
more advanced testing with these options :
--normalization batch --epochs 1 --rounds 100 --batchsize 10 --client_proportion 0.1
