only train 5 clients in each round due to memory 
IID -> learns up to normal accuracy
NIID alpha = 5 and balanced -> learns >=0.55
NIID balanced alpha=0.5 -> learns : >=0.40 accuracy

NIID unbalanced alpha = 0.5 -> doesnt learn

optimizer for calibration step : SGD lr=1e-3 wd=5e-4
MC = 200 for each class
